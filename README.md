[en] [Magrit](https://magrit.cnrs.fr) is an online mapping application developed by [UAR RIATE](https://riate.cnrs.fr/).  
[fr]  [Magrit](https://magrit.cnrs.fr) est une application de cartographie thématique développée par l'[UAR RIATE](https://riate.cnrs.fr/).

## Basics
- Magrit is an online application for thematic mapping (*cartography*).
- It's intentionally simple (the UI follows the basic steps of map creation).
- It's **designed for teaching and learning cartography**.
- It lets you import **your own geometry dataset** (**Shapefile**, **GeoJSON**, **GML**, etc.) and optionally your **tabular file**.
- We also provide many sample datasets to try out the various representations and become familiar with the application.
- It allows to **render and combine a wide variety of maps**: choropleth, proportional symbols, cartogram, discontinuity, etc.
- It supports the most popular modern desktop browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Opera (+ Edge and Safari with limitations).
- Server-side, Magrit is backed by a python 3 application (particularly for some geoprocessing tasks relying on GDAL, GEOS and PROJ libraries).
- Client-side, Magrit is written in modern JS (ES6) and uses notably the d3.js library.

## Simple installation / Installation for development
The only targeted/tested OS for development is currently GNU/Linux.   
However, you can install it on other platforms, which are supported by Docker (GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Windows 64bits, MAC OSX) which is the preferred solution if you want to install Magrit for using it but don't want to do any development:   
- [Installation with Docker](https://github.com/riatelab/magrit/wiki/Installation-with-Docker)

To install Magrit directly on your GNU/Linux system you have to install some shared libraries and python libraries.
Once installed, the python server application can take care to concatenate/transpile/etc. the JS and CSS code.
These steps are detailed in the Wiki and in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file:
