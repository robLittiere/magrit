Changes
=======

Unreleased
----------

- Fix field names vertical alignment in label creation options.

- Remove useless CSS from 404 page (which included loading a font from Google Fonts).

0.16.2 (2023-05-12)
-------------------

- Fix red dot position for labels when moving them.

0.16.1 (2023-05-11)
-------------------

0.16.0 (2023-05-11)
-------------------

- Deactivate zoom by rectangular selection when changing projection if its on.

- Improve the handling of the label positions by avoiding to reset the position of the labels when changing projection for labels that have been manually moved.

- Change CSS for inactive layers (because Inkscape does not support the "visibility" attribute on SVG elements nor the "visibility" CSS property).

- Load pictograms when loading the application instead of deferring the loading to the first time the "pictogram panel" is opened (it was causing some issues with slow network connections, because pictograms were not loaded when the user was trying to use them - see #110).

0.15.3 (2023-04-14)
-------------------

- Fix links to image from subchapters in documentation.

0.15.2 (2023-04-13)

- Update ``smoomapy`` dependency to fix some issue when bounds given by the user are very close to the min/max bounds of the data (and that could result in a class without value).

0.14.1 (2023-03-29)
-------------------

- Fix the location of labels derived from a dorling/demers (proportional symbol) layer (Fix #108). Also works on symbols that were manually moved.

0.12.1 (2022-12-06)
-------------------

- Fix an apparently old bug about reloading of old project files (project file generated around 2017 that did not yet contain version information, before 0.3.0, so probably only very few people / project files were affected).
